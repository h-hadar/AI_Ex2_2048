DESCRIPTION OF Q5:
    we took to consideration the follow features:
    - how many empty cells we have on the board
    - board score
    - mean cell score on the board
    - max tile
    - we checked witch cells can be combined horizontally and vertically
     we sum the values of those cells and took the max between the sum on the
     horizontal ones and the vertical ones.

     we returned a function of those features while giving the empty cells
     and combination sum bigger weight then 1.
